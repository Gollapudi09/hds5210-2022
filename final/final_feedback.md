# Feedback on Final

I really liked your final project and enjoyed how easily you laid out the introduction, steps, and conclusion. Excellent work.

You created one function in your notebook, `scale`, to return a rating description based on the index value.  That's a good use of that function, but would have been good to document and provide tests.  For example, what happens if you provide a value of 19.99?  It will answer "Extremely alarming" which is probably not what you want.  There are probably other places where using functions for abstraction would have been helpful, too.
